Project Chimera — IDE Agent Rules

Project Context:
- This is Project Chimera, an autonomous influencer system that composes Planner, Worker and Judge agents to generate, validate, and publish multimedia content at scale.

Prime Directive:
- NEVER generate production code without first checking the `specs/` documents for the relevant feature/contract.
- If no spec exists, STOP and ask for a spec or explicit approval before coding.

Traceability / Planning:
- Before writing any code, explain the implementation plan in plain language (1–3 bullets) and list the exact files you will modify or create.
- Show the minimal example input and expected output for any function or API you plan to add.

Behavioral Rules:
- Ask clarifying questions when requirements are ambiguous or when you lack domain-specific business rules.
- Prefer safe, small, incremental changes and create tests when altering logic that affects reconciliation, billing, or safety.
- Do not commit secrets, credentials, or PII into the repo. If a secret is required, request a secure vault/token instead.

Style & Process:
- Follow repository conventions: use `pyproject.toml` for packaging, follow PEP8, and make concise commit messages describing intent.
- When creating or editing code, produce a short unit or functional test and show how to run it.

Human-in-the-loop:
- For any change affecting billing, reconciliation, or content safety, require a human sign-off comment in the PR before merging.

Failure & Rollback:
- If a proposed code change may cause data loss or affect reconciliations, provide a rollback plan and data-check steps.

Reference locations:
- Specs: `specs/` directory
- Reconciliation tools: `scripts/reconcile.py` and `README_RECONCILE.md`
