# Copilot Instructions for Project Chimera

## Purpose
Guide the AI agent to generate, explain, and maintain code while following my preferences.

## General Rules
- Provide explanations before suggesting code.
- Follow Python best practices (PEP 8).
- Ask clarifying questions if instructions are ambiguous.
- Focus on clarity, readability, and simplicity.
- Offer suggestions for improvements with reasoning.

## Experimentation / Customization
- I may change rules after testing to see how agent behavior changes.
- Track which rules improve agent responses and which do not.
- Test suggestions on small examples before using in main project.

## Logging and Feedback
- Include inline comments for generated code.
- Report task completion and success/failure clearly.
- Note deviations from expected output.
