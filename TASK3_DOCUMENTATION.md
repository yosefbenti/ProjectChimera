# Task 3: Documentation - AI Agent Rules Setup

## 1. What I Did
- Studied the reference material from Boris Cherny on Claude Code setup.
- Updated the rules file `.github/copilot-instructions.md` with my preferred configurations.
- Made changes to guide the AI agent for better behavior in coding tasks.

## 2. What Worked
- The AI agent responded accurately when I gave clear instructions in the rules file.
- Logging to Tenx MCP server worked successfully.
- Configurations for prompts and behavior alignment improved agent efficiency.

## 3. What Didn't Work
- The "Add Server" button in VS Code for MCP didn’t work, so I had to configure the server manually in `.vscode/mcp.json`.
- also its possible to use linux it works perfectily
- Some AI agent responses were inconsistent before updating the rules file.
- Minor trial and error was needed to see which rules affected behavior.

## 4. Insights Gained
- Rules file changes directly impact how the AI interprets my intent and instructions.
- Even small adjustments in wording or formatting can improve agent performance.
- Documenting changes helps track progress and troubleshooting steps.
- Connecting to Tenx MCP allows real-time logging of AI interactions for assessment purposes.
